# RoAlgo-Educational-Archive
An Educational Archive created by the RoAlgo community, centered around the discord server with the same name

The purpose of this project is to create the most complete educational archive for a student interested in competitive programming, while focusing also on topics that frequently show up in Romanian informatics classrooms, contests and olympiads.
